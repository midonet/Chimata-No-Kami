This project will show you how to build a distributed architecture for a cache farm.

The MidoNet agents in this project are not running in a typical gateway configuration with two network cards, one of them being used for BGP or static routing.

Instead we will use local veth pairs on the varnish nodes to 'uplift' the backend traffic into the virtual networking layer of a midonet overlay.

This makes it possible to run part (or all) of this architecture in a public cloud or on servers in a datacenter with one NIC.

The overlay itself will consist of docker containers being wired to MidoNet.

The containers will run nginx webservers.

Note that most of this project is an exercise in code generation for fabric roles and job files.

A role is a job in the autogenerated/ directory.

If you have custom code you must create it under the respective directory in stages/.

The code generator will then pull it and create the fabfile that will then run.

For this to work there is a 1:1 relation between the name of a role, the Makefile target and the fabfile with the task for this role.
